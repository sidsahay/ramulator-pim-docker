# Dockerfile for ramulator-pim
Based on 64-bit Debian Stretch because of the `g++-6` dependency. After building, to run ZSim run the Docker container with `--privileged` and run `echo 0 | tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space` inside to disable ASLR (ZSim will crash without this). Based on [ramulator-pim](https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/ramulator-pim) from CMU SAFARI. Does not build the tests.
